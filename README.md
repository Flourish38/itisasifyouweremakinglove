# _It is as if you were making love_

_It is as if you were making love_ is the sequel to [_It is as if you were doing work_](https://github.com/pippinbarr/itisasifyouweredoingwork). It is an application from a near future in which humans have lost the interest and will for physical sex with other humans. The application provides you with the experience of erotically pleasuring someone without the involvement of another human being, replacing that role with a user-interface.
